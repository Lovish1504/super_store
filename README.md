# Superstore Billing System with Barcode Scanner

This project is a Python-based superstore billing system that employs a barcode scanner to scan items and generate bills for customers.

## Overview

The system allows users (cashiers or customers) to scan items using a barcode scanner. It computes the total bill amount based on the scanned items and generates a receipt for the user.

## Features

- **Barcode Scanning**: Utilizes a barcode scanner to input item details efficiently.
- **Item Database**: Contains information about items including barcode, name, price, and other relevant details.
- **Bill Generation**: Calculates the total bill amount for scanned items.
- **Receipt Generation**: Produces a receipt with a list of purchased items and their prices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Barcode scanner (if available)
- Libraries: (Install using `pip install library_name`)
    - `keyboard`: for simulating barcode scanner input
    - Other necessary libraries for specific functionalities (if applicable)

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/superstore-billing.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd superstore-billing`
3. Run the main Python file: `python main.py`

## Usage

Upon running the program, the system will wait for barcode scanner input. Once an item's barcode is scanned, it fetches the item details from the database and adds it to the bill. The process continues until the user completes scanning all items.

After scanning, the system generates a bill with a list of purchased items and their respective prices, calculating the total amount due.

### Additional Functionalities (if available)
- **Item Lookup**: Allows users to manually search for items if a barcode is unavailable.
- **Discount Application**: Provides the capability to apply discounts or coupons to the bill total.
- **Multiple Payment Options**: Supports various payment methods (cash, card, etc.) for settling the bill.
